## Les Elkins Trumpet 

Les is originally from West Virginia, growing up in Chuck Yeager's hometown. He played trumpet in high school marching bands and continued playing while he attended the West Virginia Institute of Technology in Montgomery, WV. There he also sang with the Guy Owen Baker Chorale, traveling with them to Germany, Austria, Poland, and Hungary.

When Les moved to Maryland he was pleased to find many opportunities to continue playing, including the Columbia Community Band, Rockville Brass Band, and the employee's band at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at White Oak, MD. In addition to JSS Les currently plays trumpet with the New HOTS Jazz Orchestra and occasionally the Rockville Brass Band and other groups. He has also played in some fifty-odd pit bands for community theaters in the area. Les has also appeared on stage in a number of musicals and operettas, as part of the chorus or as an occasional role in community and professional theaters in DC and Maryland.

He is pleased to have this opportunity to find the trad jazz sound, work on his improvisation (only took twenty-five years of playing to get ready to learn to improvise!) and is pleased to have yet another venue to perform with his new wife, the vocalist.

## Steve Luchter, Clarinet & Sax

Steve is our clarinet player. His lifelong interest in traditional jazz started in his high school days. He says many of the songs we play now are the same ones he played back then. That wasn't the start of his musical career; he began to play violin at age six, and continued with that instrument until age 13, when he became enamored with the clarinet. Steve says his aspires to play like Willie Humphrey, the clarinetist with the Preservation Hall Jazz band in the 80s. He feels that no one puts more feeling into his music than Willie.

When Steve graduated from high school he had to decide between engineering and music as a career and chose engineering. That didn't mean he gave up on music. In his college days he played in a big band, and over the years played in a number of concert bands. He retired in 2001 and has devoted his principal energies to music since then. His first project was to take all of the music courses offered at the Northern Virginia Community College. To sharpen his improvising, he attended several sessions of the Adult Jazz Camp offered by the San Diego jazz society America's Favorite City Jazz Society. In 2002 he co-founded Jefferson Street Strutters. 

Although his primary interest is in traditional jazz, Steve also plays Russian folk music as a member of the [*Washington Balalaika Society*](https://www.balalaika.org) orchestra where he plays the alto balalaika. He founded an ensemble from within that organization, Russkiye Musikanti, a group that plays at senior centers, schools, civic events and as the warm-up band in the lobby prior to the orchestra concerts. Steve plays percussion with that group. 

Another area of interest is as an advocate for the arts. Steve is president of the Arlington Citizens for the Arts and has appeared before the Arlington County Board and the School Board advocating for issues of interest to the arts community. 

Maybe genetic, but in any case, Steve has two sons involved in the music scene. His older son, Justin, is a bass guitar player and an expert in sound engineering. His younger son, Peter, is a drummer, presently leading a fusion jazz band.

Johnson, Willie “The Lion” Smith and Fats Waller. His second CD “Meadow Lark”, issued in April 2005, reflects his intense research, study and numerous experiences since first becoming a regular performer on the ragtime circuit. Meadow Lark includes songs of many styles, such as classic and modern-era ragtime, Harlem stride and other examples of early jazz piano music. Dave is currently working on a project to record the entire Scott Joplin repertoire while also working on another CD of ragtime, stride and early jazz pieces.

## Tom Reed, Drums & Percussion

Tom Reed holds a master’s degree in percussion performance from the University of Maryland, College Park. He grew up in north-central Pennsylvania, playing drums in local jazz and rock groups and performing with several drum and bugle corps (Milton Keystoners, Reading Buccaneers). While a mallet instrument specialist in the 1980s, playing vibraphone with The Howland Ensemble, Tom’s compositions were part of the group’s eponymous recording, which received the 1986 WAMMY Best Jazz Album and Best Debut awards. On the strength of that recording, Musician magazine included the ensemble in their 1988 Best of the Unsigned Bands compilation, Best of the BUBs (Warner Bros. PR4757), judged by Elvis Costello, Mark Knopfler, T- Bone Burnett and Mitchell Froom.

He recently retired from the AP, after spending the last decade as a supervising photo editor in the company’s State Photo Center in Washington. 

Over the last half-dozen years, Tom has devoted himself exclusively to drumming, leaving mallet playing to others, and in a kind of “return to personal basics,” once again finds himself playing small-group jazz and Latin styles, performing as a snare drummer with area drum corps (Baltimore Yankee Rebels, Hanover Lancers, American Originals Fife and Drum Corps), teaching privately, and composing and arranging for a variety of ensembles.
